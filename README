# 1. Introduction
## 1.1. Purpose

This document describes the `pynlb` library and companion CLI that interact with National Library Board (NLB) API endpoints that are provided for DevSecOps, Developers and CLI Users.

## 1.2. Audience

The audience for this document includes:

* User who will install and configure `pynlb` on their workstation to query the NLB catalog.

* Developer who will implement, build, test all commands within the `pynlb` library and companion CLI.

* DevSecOps who will configure and maintain CI/CD pipelines to automate the build process.

# 2. System Overview
## 2.1. Benefits and Values

1. This wrapper abstracts away the complexity of interacting with the NLB API endpoints by providing a Python library `pynlb` and companion command-line interface (CLI).

## 2.2. Workflow

This project uses several methods and products to optimize your workflow.
- Use a version control system (**GitHub**) to track your changes and collaborate with others.
- Use a static analyzer (**prospector**) to help write your clean code.
- Use a build tool (**Makefile**) to automate your development tasks.
- Use a package manager (**Pipenv**) to manage your dependencies.
- Use a testing framework (**pytest**) to automate your testing.
- Use a containerization platform (**Docker**) to run your application in any environment.
- Use a continuous integration pipeline (**CircleCI**) to automate your static analysis and image deployment.
- Use an artifactory (**Docker Hub**) to store and pull your image.
